> _I’m Nobody! Who are you? Are you – Nobody – too? Then there’s a pair of us!_ ~ Emily Dickinson

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

You might know me by my online alias, _bbhtt_, which is just a blend of
some letters of my real name, Boudhayan Bhattcharya. I live in India and
completed my B.Sc. (Honours) in 2021 and M.Sc. in Mathematics in 2023.
Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Mathematics. I teach Mathematics
for work and occasionally contribute to [FOSS projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
during my free time.

I love watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/bbhtt/films/),
TV shows, and [anime](https://anidb.net/user/983003), and I'm always
listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/m18qz71984e1gjbkfbd36zwmi).
Although, most of the time, I'm lost in some random YouTube binge.

I also try to read books and play some games on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/bbhtt/)
every now and then, and sometimes I mess around with casual online chess
on Lichess.

You can contact me via:
